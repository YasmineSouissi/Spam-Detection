but i came back in the house & she was talking fine on the telephone . but i ask her questions about how she feels & she is just about dead . i don ' t know about her . but she looked pale . blood sugar was a little low this morning . i woke her up at 2 & had her check it & it was good . so i got a little more rest . i don ' t think she even woke up enough to remember it . i don ' t think the little job is good for her if she ' s gonna catch everything they have . she ' s so careless about washing hands after handling all those nasty little kids & then bites her nails . not good ! anyway
